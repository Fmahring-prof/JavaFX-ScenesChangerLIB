# JFX-SceneChangerLIB

Quick and dirty SceneChanger for JavaFX.
  
    This is just because i am lazy and dont want to write it all over again. IT is NOT optimized i just made it to try make my own lib.


IMPORTANT!!

Use 
  
      FXChanger.oldStage = primaryStage;
  
in the start Method


to change scenes use:

      FXChanger.ChangeScenes("fxml", "SceneTitle");
 
in fxml use your fxml-file
