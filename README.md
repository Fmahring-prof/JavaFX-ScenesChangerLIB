# JFX-SceneChangerLIB

Quick and dirty SceneChanger for JavaFX.
  
    This is just because i am lazy and dont want to write it all over again. IT is NOT optimized i just made it to try make my own lib.
    
    If you REALLY want to use it, then use it. I dont care, it is just not good, so dont write issues you come along.
    Because was initially just for me.


IMPORTANT!!

Use 
        
        FXChanger.oldStage = <your stage(primaryStage)>;
  
in the start Method

to change scenes use:

      FXChanger.ChangeScenes("<your fxml file>", "SceneTitle");
